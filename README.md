  ## API Security
Key Security Measures
Authentication
Users must securely log in using tokens (e.g., JWT) to verify their identity before accessing protected endpoints. This prevents unauthorized access.

Authorization
Role-based access control ensures that users can only perform actions allowed for their role (e.g., hosts can manage their listings, guests can book properties). This limits what users can do and protects sensitive data.

Rate Limiting
Limits the number of requests a client can make within a certain timeframe to prevent abuse and denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, ensuring API stability.

Data Encryption
Sensitive data (passwords, payment info) is encrypted both in transit (using HTTPS) and at rest to protect against interception and breaches.

Input Validation & Sanitization
All user inputs are validated and sanitized to prevent injection attacks like SQL injection or cross-site scripting (XSS).

Why Security Matters
Protecting User Data
Personal info such as emails, passwords, and payment details must be safeguarded to maintain user trust and comply with data privacy regulations.

Securing Payments
Payment information requires strict security to prevent fraud and financial theft, protecting both users and the platform.

Maintaining System Integrity
Preventing unauthorized access and abuse helps keep the platform reliable, available, and trustworthy.

Compliance & Reputation
Strong security practices help comply with legal standards and avoid costly breaches that damage the project‚Äôs reputation.

   ## CI/CD Pipeline

   What is CI/CD?
Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines automate the process of building, testing, and deploying code changes. This ensures that new features and fixes are delivered quickly and reliably without manual intervention.

Why CI/CD is Important for This Project
Faster Development: Automates repetitive tasks, allowing the team to focus on building features.

Early Bug Detection: Automated tests run on every code change, catching issues before deployment.

Consistent Deployments: Reduces human error by automating deployment steps.

Improved Collaboration: Helps multiple developers work together smoothly by integrating changes frequently.

Tools That Can Be Used
GitHub Actions: Integrated with GitHub, it automates workflows such as testing and deployment on code push or pull requests.

Docker: Containerizes the application, making it easy to deploy consistently across different environments.

Jenkins / CircleCI / Travis CI: Popular CI/CD platforms that support complex pipelines and integrations.

Heroku / AWS / Azure: Cloud platforms where the application can be deployed automatically after successful builds and tests.
